## Keynotes

### Communitaction

Communicating to business, should start from Why, then proceed to what.

Why has to be a business benefit.
I was aware (from my time in the bank) about

- Make us moeny
- Stop us from losing money
- Stop us from going out of business

I learned about:

- Beat the competition.

### Experimental sprints

- Define clear outcome predictions
- Timebox

## Concerto for Java and AI - Building Production-Ready LLM Applications - Thomas Vitale

https://www.devoxx.co.uk/talk/?id=3804

- used ollama
- spring-ai
  - chatclient can build complex prompts
  - RetrievalAugmentedAdvisor `chatClient.prompt().advisors()`
- Used Ai to extract tags for musical components
- Used Ai to propose components for the musical composition of a movie
- Used Ai to text to speech, then extract director notes for the musical pieces

## Top REST API Design Pitfalls - Victor Rentea

Tools to detect implemtnation drift:

- https://pact.io
- https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-contract

Concepts:

- Scalability
  - perfromance
  - behaviour
- DTO: don't use use Request/Response
- MapStruct (or other mappers)
  - When mapping is painfull get rid of it and switch to manual
- CQRS
  - separate read/write models
  - Commands for write vs Queries for read
- no result for PUT, ids only for POST
- Action buttons with dedicated endpoints over edit screens
- All errors at the same response
  - https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457.html

## Mini Lab- Create AI-Infused Apps with LangChain4j (and Quarkus) - Kevin Dubois

Used Quarkus to play around with an LLM

- https://quarkus.io/quarkus-workshop-langchain4j/
- (actual workshop) https://quarkus.io/quarkus-workshop-langchain4j/requirements/

Note:
For podman in linux you have to export a property in the environment: https://quarkus.io/guides/podman. Also remember to qualify images with docker.io/xxx

```
export DOCKER_HOST=unix://$(podman info --format '{{.Host.RemoteSocket.Path}}')
```

I could not make open telemetry work. (micrometer and quarkus were not playing nicely together)

- use llm as guardrail against prompt injection
- RAG
- MCP
- prompt class will instruct LLm to only answer in the expected format
- if return type is `Stream<String>` the LLm si streaming responses back

## What is multimodal RAG, and can we build a village with it? - Alexander Chatzizacharias

- https://github.com/glycin/rag-village
- RAG term was invented by Patrick Leweis in 2005
- LLama model
- CLIP multimodal embedding model - iamges
- CLAP multimodal embedding model - audio

## Functional Programming Code Smells - Victor Rentea

- https://github.com/victorrentea/clean-code-java/tree/devoxx-uk-2025
- https://github.com/uber/NullAway
- Jpa Repositories can return stream (but then processing happens inside the transaction)

## Patterns of Legacy Displacement - Rob Horn

- https://www.devoxx.co.uk/talk/?id=21369
- [Rob Horn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-horn)

- incremental displacement
- transitional architecture

  - service providing

## Java 21: The revolution of virtual threads - Christian Worz

- https://www.devoxx.co.uk/talk/?id=8052
- https://twitter.com/@chwoerz
- Java 21
- (reminder for me to use Jmeter)
- `Thread.ofPlatform()... Thread.ofVirtual()`
- spring web: `spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true` (off by default to nnot break the 1% of projects that could be impacted)
- StructuredTaskScope
  - ThreadLocal does not work as expected there (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-za5Rxxh5o, https://typed.rocks/st)
  - Extend to access handleComplete
  - synchronized correct after java 24
  - Native calls pins thread

## Write Once, Deploy Everywhere: From Containers to Serverless - James Ward, Matthew Meckes

https://www.devoxx.co.uk/talk/?id=22657

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesward, https://bsky.app/profile/jamesward.com, https://twitter.com/_JamesWard

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmeckes, https://bsky.app/profile/mmeckes, https://twitter.com/mmeckes

- Jib for pacjaging (best for java)? vs BuildPacks, vs Docker
- EKS automode
- code for both standalone and lambda: https://github.com/aws/serverless-java-container
  - many endpoint to one lambda
  - possbile all GET in one lambda all modifications in another (so that they can run with different privileges)
- https://github.com/jamesward/springboot_bars/tree/lambda-web
- SnapStart https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html
  - consider DB Priming
- https://catalog.workshops.aws/java-on-aws
- aws `q chat --non-interactive ...` https://aws.amazon.com/q/
- Test Containers
  - Use `@RestartScope` to limit the restarts/creations during the test (other wise OOM?)

## Spring Boot testing: Zero to Hero - Daniel Garnier-Moiroux

- https://www.linkedin.com/in/garniermoiroux, https://twitter.com/@kehrlann
- https://github.com/Kehrlann/spring-boot-testing
- use `maven sprinb-boot:test-run` -`MockMvcTester` autowired bean allows testing
- `@SpringBootTest`
- `@AutoconfigureWebMvc`
- `org.htmlunit` `WebClient` to test page and run it (not as good as selinium but good for simple stuff)
- Trick: greeakpoint for one thread only inside the unittest, and then you can observer running server and iterract with it and its state
- Test Context
  - activate debug logs for DefaultContextCache
- Test slices
- '@ExtendWith(CaptureOutput.class)` (or something) to capture the output (including logs) so you can verify that auditing was logged.
- assertJ `assertThat().extracting().filtering()`
- `@WewbMvcTest` creates only some beans (controllers etc) you have to mock the rest
- TestContainers
  - initializr will get the right test containers for your depednecies
  - `spring.docker.compose` allows you to configure paramters for local runs (TestContiners will pick thme up?)
  - `@ServiceConnection` when the testcontainer bean is created
  - `@TestCOnfiguration(processBean=false)` make the bean return a static object (to not create them many times per test)
  - `@DynamicPropertySource` can interogate the container object for parameters
- Security
  - `@WithMockUser` will inject the user access_token (username, roles fluent interface)
  - `spring-security-test`
  - `logging.level.org.springsecurity=TRACE` (???)
  - `MockMvcTester.post().with(SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessor.csrf())`
    - thymeleaf page can have form with \_csrf.xxxName \_csrf.Value
    - MockMvcTester.post()(?).oidcLogin()..idtoken().claim("email","aaa@bbb.com")

## Every Event, Everywhere, All at Once - Jacqui Read

- https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacquelineread

Event driven stuff

- Event has happened (past tense)

I did not know about EventObject in Java

- Event vs command
  - event has happened
    - result
    - immutable
    - in the past
    - does not care about consumers
  - command is a request for an action
    - intent

handler: listener+ callback

Event storming is a way to analyse/design systems (colors not important legent very important)

- orange: events
- green: opporutinities
- pink (45 deg rotated): Hotspot
- yellow actors
- purple system
- blue arrow voting (important to have the name/initial on arrow)

Pivotal events (public events), bounded context (between pivotal events)

3 flavours of event storming

- discovery oriented
- process modeling
  - design oriented
  - smaller group
- software design

Event sourcing: updates of each change. To get state at a point in time read all updates up to that time.

Domain events. (Domain Driven Design Orange book (free))

Integration events , dimain events

All events are domain events - itegration events (public) - private events (specific to each subsystem)

Event is in the continouum between notification (0 context/less data) and snapshot(100% context/more data)

- As small as possible
- as large as necessary

If you get only Id everyone has to read source to find out what changed.

Non event

## DiffBlue

Automatic creation of tests for existing production code
[link](https://www.diffblue.com/)

## Unblocked

A.I. that provides context and answeres developers questions. Context: Documetntation, slack conversations, code.

- Slack integration (bot that responsds to questions in a thread)
- Data shield (verbally told: a way to isolate access to sensitive information to people allowed to see it. Answers can be shared with rest of team if deemed safe.)
